    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    This privacy policy details how user information is stored, used, and shared by Make My Schedule.<br>
    Make My Schedule can be abbreviated as MMS. MMS offers a chrome extension available on the Chrome Web Store and a website at <a href="https://make-my-schedule.com">make-my-schedule.com</a>.<br>
    <br>
    TLDR: Your schedules are only stored on your computer. Analytics, such as the buttons you click within the extension, your email, and your payment status are stored and viewable by MMS. Sensetive data such as your history and registration information are never stored or shared by MMS.<br>
    <br>
    Website:<br>
    <br>
    The website make-my-schedule.com is static. Basic user metrics such as visits and requests are counted and stored by CloudFlare. Google Analytics also collects basic user metrics such as visits, rough geographic location, requests, and button clicks. Identifiable information such as payment info, email, passwords and passwords are not accessed, stored, or shared through this website.<br>
    For more information, view the policies of CloudFlare and Google Analytics.<br>
    <br>
    Extension:<br>
    <br>
    Extension data falls into three categories: Payment Verification, Locally Stored, and Analytic.<br>
    <br>
    Payment Verification:<br>
    Payment is required to use the MMS extension. In order to verify payment has been successful, some payment information must be stored, namely your chrome profile's email.<br>
    <br>
    Locally Stored:<br>
    In order to save your schedules, preferences, and account id, the MMS extension stores information locally on your computer. No other information is stored.<br>
    <br>
    Analytic:<br>
    Some information is collected and shared with MMS to improve services, detect errors, and ensure payment verification security. This information is collected through Google Analytics. The following events are logged and sent to MMS:<br>
    <br>
    - A user installing the extension<br>
    - A user clicking one of the following buttons:<br>
    <div class="indent">

    </div>
    <br>
    The time and an anonymous user id are stored for each of these events.<br>
    <br>
    Information such as email (for payment verification) can be deleted upon request. Deleting your email will block you from accessing MMS. All other information held by MMS cannot be deleted upon request as it has no identifying characteristics to match to a user. Locally stored information can be deleted by removing the extension or clicking "Clear Data".<br>
    <br>
    This is a small project, so please be understanding. Rules can be updated and this is just a guideline according to my best knowledge and good faith. If you can't access your account, want a refund, or something else, please contact me, and we will try to resolve the issue.
