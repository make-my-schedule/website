<button type="button" class="collapsible">Go to Registration</button>
<div class="content">

</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Term</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: "(Semester) (Year)"
    This is the term you are planning for, such as Spring 2025 or Fall 2024. It will default to Spring 2025 if nothing is provided.
    If you have "Auto-Input Term" turned on, this term will be automatically selected on pages for you. Otherwise, this has no effect.

<div class="content">
    Format: "(Subject)(Course Number), (Subject)(Course Number), (Subject)(Course Number), [etc...]"
    Here is where you type in the classes that must be in your schedule. Type in the subject and course number (for example, Chemistry 1 is CHGN121). Separate classes by a comma (spaces are ignored).
    It is not case-sensitive.
    If "Auto-Input Classes" is turned on, these will be automatically inputted into pages for you. If not, this has no effect.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Auto-Input Classes</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: On/Off
    Suggested: On
    When turned on, the "Classes" you typed in above will be automatically inputted on pages for you. When turned off, you'll have to type in classes manually.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Auto-Read Table</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: On/Off
    Suggested: On
    When turned on, the table of class data will automatically be read and processed. If turned off, you must click "Read Table" manually at the top of the page to ingest class information.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">At least [_] open seats</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: Whole number
    This is the minimum number of open seats a class can have to be put in your schedule. For example, a value of 5 means all classes must have 5 or more seats available right now. A value of 0 means even full classes should be put into your schedule.
    Defaults to 3 if nothing is inputted. Open seats does not count waitlist seats. 
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Start after [_]</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: Time
    This is the earliest time any classes can be. All classes will start at or after this time. For example, "8:30 AM" means no classes will be before 8:30 AM.
    Defaults to midndight if nothing is inputted.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">End before [_]</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: Time

</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Require Professors</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: "(Professor Name), (Professor Name), (Professor Name), [etc...]"
    These are the professors you want to be in your schedule. If one of those professors is available for a class, it will require the one they teach. For example, let's say you type in "Bob Dylan", and he teaches Discrete Math. All discrete math classes not taught by him will be filtered out. But, since he doesn't teach Global Studies, it won't filter any of those out.
    Separate professor names by a comma. The name must be a substring to count (for example, inputting "Bob" will match "Prof. Bob Dylan Jr." and "Jeffrey Bobbert"). Case sensistive.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Require CRN</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: "(CRN), (CRN), (CRN), [etc...]"
    These are the CRNs of classes you want to be in your schedule. If a schedule doesn't have that specific CRN in it, it will be fitlered out. If two CRNs for the same class are given, then either can be included.
    Separate CRNs by a comma.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Exclude Professors</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: "(Professor Name), (Professor Name), (Professor Name), [etc...]"
    These are the professors you don't want to be in your schedule. Any classes taught by these professors will be filtered out.

    Separate building names by a comma. Case sensitive. Must be the full building name.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Exclude From [_] to [_] [_]</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: Time, Time, Days
    From the first time to the last time on the days selected will be blocked out. No classes can take place during these timeslots.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">[_] Spread Out - Dense</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: On/Off, Slider
    Drag the slider left for a more scattered, spread out schedule. Drag the slider right for a densely packed schedule.
    This is calculated by, for each day, subtracting the earliest class' starting time by the latest class' ending time, then taking the average.
    Uncheck on the left to turn off sorting by density.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">[_] Earlier - Later</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: On/Off, Slider
    Drag the slider left for an earlier schedule. Drag the slider right for a later schedule.
    This is calculated by getting the time in the middle of each class and averaging them all.
    Uncheck on the left to turn off sorting by lateness.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">[_] Varied - Consistent</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: On/Off, Slider
    Drag the slider left for a highly varied schedule day-to-day. Drag the slider right for a very consistent schedule, where each day is similar.
    This is calculated by counting how many classes overlap across the week in 10 minute chunks. More overlaps means daily schedules are more consistent.
    Uncheck on the left to turn off sorting by consistency.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">[_] Any ratings - High ratings</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: On/Off, Slider

</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Lawless CRN</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: "(CRN), (CRN), (CRN), [etc...]"
    Classes with these CRNs will ignore all rules and filters set above. For example, if you input "10423", the class with that CRN will be put in schedules even if it's during a blocked time, doesn't have enough seats open, etc.
    Separate CRNs by a comma.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Maximum Schedules to generate</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: Whole number
    This is the maximum number of schedules that will be generated before stopping. For example, if you input 100, only 100 schedules will be generated. This can be helpful if you have a slow computer.
    Defaults to 1 million.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Pre-Randomize</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: On/Off
    Suggested: On
    When turned on, the order of classes will be randomized before generating or sorting schedules. This means that if two schedules are given equal scores when sorting, one will randomly be before the other. Also, if the maximum number of schedules is hit, then which ones are generated and which ones are skipped will be randomly selected.
    This helps to ensure that not every student plans on taking the exact same schedule, when there are equally good alternatives. If turned off, their order will be purely deterministic.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Zoom Out - Zoom In</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: Slider
    This adjusts how zoomed in/out the schedule viewing is.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Sort class alternatives by</button>
<div class="content">
    Format: Dropdown
    Some classes have the exact same timeslot but different professors, seats, or classroom. These are shown as "alternatives" you can select on the top bar. This determines how those alternatives are sorted.
    Seats open: Put alternatives with the most seats open first
    Professor rating: Put alternatives with the highest professor rating first
    Both: Equally weight seats open and professor ratings, then put the best first
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Save Preferences</button>
<div class="content">
    Save all the preferences above. If you're viewing a list of schedules, it will re-filter and re-sort schedules based on new preferences.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Save Current Schedule</button>
<div class="content">
    Save the schedule you're viewing now. You can view, update, remove, and plan these schedules.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Clear Data</button>
<div class="content">
    Clear all data you saved. This includes saved schedules, classes, filters, and everything else in the extension.
</div>
